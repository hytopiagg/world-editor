# Debug Cleanup Summary

## Files Removed:
- `debug-models.html` - Debug interface for testing environment models loading
- `test-performance.js` - Performance testing script with console output
- `public/test-models.html` - Environment models loading test page
- Multiple documentation files from optimization work:
  - `PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
  - `FIXED_PERFORMANCE_SOLUTION.md` 
  - `FINAL_PERFORMANCE_FIX.md`
  - `POST_LOAD_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS.md`
  - `BACKGROUND_LOADING_INDICATOR.md`
  - `BACKGROUND_LOADING_FINAL.md`
  - `TERRAIN_INTERACTION_BLOCKING.md`

## Console Logs Cleaned:
- Removed debug `handleMouseDown` console.log
- Removed "üö´ Terrain interaction blocked" debug messages  
- Removed "Loading custom blocks and terrain in background" verbose logging
- Removed "üåç Loading world with X blocks" verbose logging
- Removed "üîÑ Loading remaining textures in background" verbose logging
- Removed "üîÑ Initializing 3D rendering system" verbose logging
- Removed "üîÑ Preloading remaining textures" verbose logging
- Removed "üîÑ Processing chunk batch X/Y" verbose logging
- Removed texture batch loading verbose logging

## Performance Tips Cleaned:
- Converted performance tips console output to debug-only (requires `?debug=true` URL param)
- Kept PerformanceProfiler functionality but hidden behind debug flag

## What Remains:
- Essential completion messages (‚úÖ World loaded successfully, ‚úÖ Chunk processing complete)
- Error logging for debugging issues
- PerformanceProfiler available for debugging with `?debug=true`
- All functionality intact, just cleaner console output

## Result:
- Much cleaner console output in production
- No debug files cluttering the repository  
- Performance profiling still available when needed
- All core functionality preserved
